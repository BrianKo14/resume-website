	<p id="description">This is a preliminary model for an immersive adventure game set on a deserted island. It's a personal project that I started in 2020, and which quickly outgrew its origins. Built mostly in Unity, the island is 25 km² (9.7 sq mi). A lush, bright green world set on an endless ocean. The player lands on the Upper Pleateau, in a clearing with a view to the Volcano’s Summit, and they are free to roam. Roam through forests, beaches, caves, shipwrecks and ancient temples. The goal? The fancy of every childhood: a treasure hunt—solving puzzles for a way out.</p>

		description="The map would tell the story. The island is the subject of the game, and the purpose is the exploration of its landmarks. This is an early concept for its design, the hope is to fill it with all the mystery and wonder that could drive the player's whim to discover. Ideas are plentiful: what happened before the player arrived? An ancient civilization, previous explorers, pirates, and a Lockheed Electra 10E with a letter addressed to Amelia Earhart?"

		description="The sky makes half of the game's visual domain, so it is important. The skybox is a living thing, with clouds that move and change shape, and a sun that sets and rises. What's more, an accurate star map could provide some of the first clues for a player who is not yet acquainted with the island. This took some figuring out, but doesn't it look great?"

		description="Rendering 25 km² of rocks and trees is a challenge. Two solutions: LOD and occlusion culling. The first is a technique that reduces the detail of objects as they move away from the camera by replacing them with simpler models. The second is the hiding of objects that are not visible to the camera. I divided the island into 16 regions which I further subdivided into smaller tiles. Those that the player cannot see, are not rendered. The result is a world that runs smoothly on a mid-range computer."
