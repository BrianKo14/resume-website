	<p id="description">I recreated this project three times, simply because it's so much fun. The idea is the following: natural evolution isn't just evidenced in the physical world, but is also a logical conjecture about learning processes involving trial and error. Therefore, it can be demonstrated in a computer. In essence, my ecosystem consists of a canvas, and my living creatures are blobs of three types: food, primary and secondary consumers.</p>
