### This is my portfolio website

I'm still working on the landing page—here's the [Figma project for its design](https://www.figma.com/design/oFFPpzf9ebyVgsi3SW8t3A/Resume-Website?node-id=0-1&t=POdGjlho7xkjRIsr-1) (it's really cool).
The sites for each individual project (`projects/`) are almost done but for a few details. At the moment I've got them linked up to [my resumé](https://brianko14.github.io/resume-website/resume.pdf), so give that a look if you still haven't.
